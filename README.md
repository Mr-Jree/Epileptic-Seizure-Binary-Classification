# Epileptic Seizure Binary Classification

This repository contains the jupyter notebook for classifying whether an epiletpic patient is having a seizure or not, through EEG readings, along with the raw data, processed datasets, and tpot automl outputs.

The original dataset came from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Epileptic+Seizure+Recognition)

This project was completed as a capstone project during my Master's at Northeastern University.
